# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I 3-and-a-half hours this morning working on the Random Quote Project for Free Code Camp and finished it after spending another hout-and-a-half early this afternoon. 

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 5 hours 

**Thoughts** Morning: This is eternally frustrating and right now I hope whoever came up with this API crap dies in firey lake full of piranas. I feel like a hack (aka script kiddy), can't even get the CSS looking halfway decent without help. I'll come back to this later today but I've had enough for now. 

Early Afternoon: I finished the project at 1:40pm, only ended up taking a 30-45 minute break before I couldn't stand it and had to get back to it. Got the project done with Twitter integration and all. It's not responsive and therefore looks terrible on mobile but altogether I think it's a decent solution for the project.
