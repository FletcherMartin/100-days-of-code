# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent 3-and-a-half hours this morning working on the Random Quote Project for Free Code Camp and finished it after spending another hout-and-a-half early this afternoon. 

**Thoughts** Morning: This is eternally frustrating and right now I hope whoever came up with this API crap dies in firey lake full of piranas. I feel like a hack (aka script kiddy), can't even get the CSS looking halfway decent without help. I'll come back to this later today but I've had enough for now. 

Early Afternoon: I finished the project at 1:40pm, only ended up taking a 30-45 minute break before I couldn't stand it and had to get back to it. Got the project done with Twitter integration and all. It's not responsive and therefore looks terrible on mobile but altogether I think it's a decent solution for the project.

### Day 2: Jan 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed my FreeCodeCamp Local Weather Project. 

**Thoughts** Today was a lot easier than yesterday. I think I actually have a grasp on apis now. I used two for the local weather project I made today - one that pulled the user's geolocation and another that used their locale to generate weather information. 

I'm not sure how long I was coding for. I know I woke up a little before 7am, but I'm not sure when I started coding. I took a shower, got breakfast and dove in while eating, so I'm pretty sure I started around 8am but I'm not 100% certain. The project was finished by 1pm, which I think is pretty good timing for being so green at this. The background image changes based on local temp and there's a toggle that switches the measurement from F to C and back with a nice jQuery fade animation. And I did it with little to no outside or Google assistance necessary - for the code I mean, of course I used Google for the images. 

Altogether it was a much better experience than yesterday.

### Day 1: Jan 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts** I woke up at 4:45, was coding by 5:30, was stumped by Wiki's Api system by 6:15, was becoming increasingly frustrated so I decided to take a break for a bit and get some food. 

No one on the FreeCodeCamp Forum seemed to have any suggestions or answers for me, so I picked it back up at 8:30am and began looking for a new method. I wound up solving the problem by 9:15am. My wiki api is working. All that's left now is some CSS to make it look good and possibly a bit of jquery to animate it. Although I'm going to put that on pause due to some very loud construction workers and errands I need to run. 

I got back to coding around 12:30pm and now it's almost 6:30. The main hangups were layout related and clearing the results between each search. I wanted to go with a fadeOut() effect but because I created the results in divs I had to settle for empty(). I tried about 10 different ways to get the fade effect instead but after an hour I figured it was time to move on.

Ultimately I'm satisfied with how the Wiki Viewer turned out, but I wouldn't say I'm happy about it. I actually forgot all about the bonus challenge of adding an autocomplete feature to the search but it's already pretty late as it is. I sctill have a long way to go. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 8 hours 15 minutes 

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 18 hours 15 minutes
