# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent 3-and-a-half hours this morning working on the Random Quote Project for Free Code Camp and finished it after spending another hout-and-a-half early this afternoon. 

**Thoughts** Morning: This is eternally frustrating and right now I hope whoever came up with this API crap dies in firey lake full of piranas. I feel like a hack (aka script kiddy), can't even get the CSS looking halfway decent without help. I'll come back to this later today but I've had enough for now. 

Early Afternoon: I finished the project at 1:40pm, only ended up taking a 30-45 minute break before I couldn't stand it and had to get back to it. Got the project done with Twitter integration and all. It's not responsive and therefore looks terrible on mobile but altogether I think it's a decent solution for the project. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 5 hours

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 5 hours


### Day 2: Jan 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed my FreeCodeCamp Local Weather Project. 

**Thoughts** Today was a lot easier than yesterday. I think I actually have a grasp on apis now. I used two for the local weather project I made today - one that pulled the user's geolocation and another that used their locale to generate weather information. 

I'm not sure how long I was coding for. I know I woke up a little before 7am, but I'm not sure when I started coding. I took a shower, got breakfast and dove in while eating, so I'm pretty sure I started around 8am but I'm not 100% certain. The project was finished by 1pm, which I think is pretty good timing for being so green at this. The background image changes based on local temp and there's a toggle that switches the measurement from F to C and back with a nice jQuery fade animation. And I did it with little to no outside or Google assistance necessary - for the code I mean, of course I used Google for the images. 

Altogether it was a much better experience than yesterday. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 5 hours

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 10 hours 


### Day 3: Jan 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed my FreeCodeCamp Wiki Finder Project

**Thoughts** I woke up at 4:45, was coding by 5:30, was stumped by Wiki's Api system by 6:15, was becoming increasingly frustrated so I decided to take a break for a bit and get some food. 

No one on the FreeCodeCamp Forum seemed to have any suggestions or answers for me, so I picked it back up at 8:30am and began looking for a new method. I wound up solving the problem by 9:15am. My wiki api is working. All that's left now is some CSS to make it look good and possibly a bit of jquery to animate it. Although I'm going to put that on pause due to some very loud construction workers and errands I need to run. 

I got back to coding around 12:30pm and now it's almost 6:30. The main hangups were layout related and clearing the results between each search. I wanted to go with a fadeOut() effect but because I created the results in divs I had to settle for empty(). I tried about 10 different ways to get the fade effect instead but after an hour I figured it was time to move on.

Ultimately I'm satisfied with how the Wiki Viewer turned out, but I wouldn't say I'm happy about it. I actually forgot all about the bonus challenge of adding an autocomplete feature to the search but it's already pretty late as it is. I sctill have a long way to go. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 8 hours 15 minutes 

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 18 hours 15 minutes

### Day 4: Jan 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my FreeCodeCamp Twitch.tv API Project 

**Thoughts** Had a late start this morning (9:30am) but the Twitch.tv project is going swimmingly. All the functionality is in place and I should be able to add a function where people can add and remove channels at will. The project creates each channel's div row dynamically. All I really have to do is complete the CSS. It's 11:30am now and I have a prospective job/client call sometime between now and 5:30pm that I need to prepare for, so the project is getting put on hold for the time being. 

It's 5:30pm and I've just completed the project. It's easily the one I'm most proud of. Not only does it populate with 3 random channels, users can check and add their own channels instantly just by typing in the channel name. It's very minimal but functional and should look good on any mobile device. It was a nice way to end the Intermediate Front End Projects. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 6 hours

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 24 hours 15 minutes

### Day 5: Jan 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour-and-half on the FreeCodeCamp Javascript calculator project, but today I'll be focusing more on the scripting challenges than project coding. 

**Thoughts** I'm starting to feel coding fatigue. I've been eating, sleeping and breathing code for about 10 days straight now. I've spent 12+ hours each day learning code. On top of that I'm irritated/depressed about my current job prospects and that I'll likely be homeless Feb 1. 

I don't think it'll kill me to take today (which is Saturday) a little easy. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 25 hours 45 minutes

### Day 6: Jan 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued taking the weekend easy. Only spent an hour on the calculator project, getting the CSS together. Trying to knock out the intermediate algorithm challenges - of course time spent on those doesn't count.  

**Thoughts** With the CSS complete all I have to do is get the functionality going, which should make the calculator project fairly simple from here onward. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 1 hour

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 26 hours 45 minutes

### Skip/Sick Day 1: Jan 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm breaking the rules a bit. I didn't work on any projects, focused more on challenges. 

**Thoughts** It's 10pm and frankly I didn't code much today. I got caught up thinking about how I'm going to be homeless come Feb 1st and cant land a job to save my life. I did code for a few hours, working on FCC algorithm challenges. Running into road block after road block on the challenges didn't help my mood, but I did learn a .reduce() function that may help with the Javascript Calc project. I spent about 3-4 hours on the challenges and then distracted myself from my life for the remainder of the day.  

Speaking of the Javascript Calc Project, while I may not have actively worked on it I did think about the project quite a bit. My plan is to assign each button its labeled designation, allow the input to add each button press to an array and then join the array together to run the equation whenever '=' is pressed. The problem is the order of operations. Eg. If 3*3+3/3 is input into the calculator, the order of operations dictate that the answer is 10 (i.e. 9+1 because the multiplication and division occur before the addition). However, if the order of operations isn't followed the answer comes out to 4 if conducted strictly from left to right. 

It's the biggest issue I face with the calculator, especially since I added the possibility for square roots and exponents too - which I may take off in order to simply and get through the project. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 0 hours (on projects at least)

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 26 hours 45 minutes
