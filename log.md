# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've spent 3 hours this morning working on the Random Quote Project for Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts** Morning: This is eternally frustrating and right now I hope whoever came up with this API crap dies in firey lake full of piranas. I feel like a hack (aka script kiddy), can't even get the CSS looking halfway decent without help. I'll come back to this later today but I've had enough for now.
