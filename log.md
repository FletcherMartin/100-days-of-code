# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent 3-and-a-half hours this morning working on the Random Quote Project for Free Code Camp and finished it after spending another hout-and-a-half early this afternoon. 

**Thoughts** Morning: This is eternally frustrating and right now I hope whoever came up with this API crap dies in firey lake full of piranas. I feel like a hack (aka script kiddy), can't even get the CSS looking halfway decent without help. I'll come back to this later today but I've had enough for now. 

Early Afternoon: I finished the project at 1:40pm, only ended up taking a 30-45 minute break before I couldn't stand it and had to get back to it. Got the project done with Twitter integration and all. It's not responsive and therefore looks terrible on mobile but altogether I think it's a decent solution for the project. 

**Time Spent Coding Today**: 5 hours

**Total Time Spent Coding**: 10 hours


### Day 2: Jan 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed my FreeCodeCamp Local Weather Project. 

**Thoughts** Today was a lot easier than yesterday. I think I actually have a grasp on apis now. I used two for the local weather project I made today - one that pulled the user's geolocation and another that used their locale to generate weather information. 

I'm not sure how long I was coding for. I know I woke up a little before 7am, but I'm not sure when I started coding. I took a shower, got breakfast and dove in while eating, so I'm pretty sure I started around 8am but I'm not 100% certain. The project was finished by 1pm, which I think is pretty good timing for being so green at this. The background image changes based on local temp and there's a toggle that switches the measurement from F to C and back with a nice jQuery fade animation. And I did it with little to no outside or Google assistance necessary - for the code I mean, of course I used Google for the images. 

Altogether it was a much better experience than yesterday.
